WSDLtoJS

xslt to generate template JavaScript from Cascade Server WSDL

It runs. I haven't verified it is complete yet, but it is generating 16,292 lines of output.

The code it is generating does pass JSLint, it has not been field verified for all arguments.

I will use this to improve the [Grunt Cascade Examples Wiki](https://github.com/jraller/Grunt-Cascade-Examples/wiki).

# To Do

- [x] Fix the comma issue
- [x] Pull comments from in the WSDL context if possible and turn them into js comments.
- [ ] Share with the larger community at the Cascade Server Users Conference.
